This program runs the MCMC with HRG model and the input graph G under calibrated distribution

*** PROGRAM USAGE NOTES ****************************************************************************

  privHRG is a command line program that takes a simple graph file and runs
  a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample Hierarchical Random Graph models
  from a calibrated distribution in order to satisfying differential privacy.
  -f <file>       Input .pairs graph file
  -epsilonHRG <real number>    Input privacy budget for HRG
  -epsilonE <real number>  Input privacy budget for edge perturbation
  -eq <integer>		threshold for manually forcing MCMC stop after eq*n steps and reaching convergence
  -stop <integer>   threshold for manually stop MCMC stop after stop*n
  -pub_round <integer> number of public round
  -priv_round <integer> number of private round
For example
  ./privHRG -f data/mir_priv.pairs
  ./privHRG -f data/mir_priv.pairs -epsilonHRG 0.5 -epsilonE 0.5 -pub_round 1000 -priv_round 10


*** IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES ****************************************************************************
1. All programs are tested on Unix/Linux systems;
2. All datasets are put inside the folder ./data;
3. The input graph file to the algorithm must be a text file containing an edge list for the graph in question; 
nodes are indexed by integers only, indices are separated by a tab, and edges are terminated by a 
carriage return. 
For instance, here is a pair of triangles linked by a single edge:
1        2
1        3
2        3
4        5
4        6
5        6
1        4
If the input .pairs file is formatted incorrectly, the program will crash.
