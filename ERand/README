This program runs the MCMC with HRG model and the input graph G under calibrated distribution
****************************************************************************************************
*** PROGRAM USAGE NOTES ****************************************************************************

  privHRG is a command line program that takes a simple graph file and runs
  a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample Hierarchical Random Graph models
  from a calibrated distribution in order to satisfying differential privacy.
  -f <file>       Input .pairs graph file
  -epsilonHRG <real number>    Input privacy budget for HRG
  -epsilonE <real number>  Input privacy budget for edge perturbation
  -make <file>    Build random graph from <dataname>_<tag>-dendro.hrg dendrogram file
  -eq <integer>		threshold for manually forcing MCMC stop after eq*n steps and reaching convergence
  -stop <integer>   threshold for manually stop MCMC stop after stop*n
For example
  ./privHRG -f data/karate.pairs
  ./privHRG -f data/karate.pairs -epsilonHRG 0.5 -epsilonE 0.5
  ./privHRG -f data/karate.pairs -epsilonHRG 0.5 -epsilonE 0.5 -eq 3000 -stop 4000
  ./privHRG -make karate_sample-dendrogram.hrg -epsilonE 0.5


*** IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES ****************************************************************************
1. All programs are tested on Unix/Linux systems;
2. All datasets are put inside the folder ./data;
3. All hrg input file must follow the name format <dataname>_<tag>-dendro.hrg, e.g. karate_sample-dendrogram.hrg. We use <dataname> to recognize the original dataset in the ./data folder. The program will crash if the name format is not correct;
4. All output random graphs will be put inside the folder ./output/<timestamp>;
5. The input graph file to the algorithm must be a text file containing an edge list for the graph in question; 
nodes are indexed by integers only, indices are separated by a tab, and edges are terminated by a 
carriage return. 
For instance, here is a pair of triangles linked by a single edge:
1        2
1        3
2        3
4        5
4        6
5        6
1        4
If the input .pairs file is formatted incorrectly, the program will crash.
